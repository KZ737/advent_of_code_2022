Create the map of the cave with full of 0s initially (air).
Then iterate over all rocks and fill the ones given in the input (normalized by the bounds) with 1s.
Unfortunately the indexing of matrix elements is done in the reverse order compared to the coordinate view (i.e. the "elevation" (the row number) is the first index), so we have to use them in reverse order.
